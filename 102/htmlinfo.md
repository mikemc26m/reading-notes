Basics of HTML

HTML is code that is used to structure a webpage and the content within it. To properly display a webpage, certain tags have to be present. The HTML code itself is used to structure the page, where css is used for the presentation.

A webpage has structure that needs to be consistant for it to work. All pages have basic elements that a browser needs to render it properly.

HTML uses elements that you use to enclose content to make it appear as you wish. Tags surround the elements and usually have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some Tags do not need a closing tag, for example adding an image does not require it.

When creating an html page, it must be saved with a file extension of "html" for it to work. The home page for websites usually is called index.html.
