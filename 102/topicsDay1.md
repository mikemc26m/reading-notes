# Class 1 - Accounts Setup, Learn Markdown - Growth Mindset

Set up accounts with: Github, Slack, Remo and Canavas. By lunchtime you will have made your first webpage on [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) using [markdown language](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). We also covered Growth Mindset - [How you can benefit from a growth mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset).

### [Code Fellows Professional Competencies](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/common/professional-competencies)

 _Growth Mindset_ - The attitude of contenuous learning. Three main ways I plan to keep on the path to personal growth:

* Paying Attention

             * Growth sometimes comes from learning from others. This can be accomplished simply by paying attention. You can gain valuable information by seeing what others have gone through.

* Never Stop Learning

            * None of us know it all. Theere is a saying if you do the thing you love, then you will never work a day in your life. **DOING** things and assessing the results can give insightful information on what works and what doesn't. Practice, repetition and even failure hone ones abilities.

* Challenges / Rewards

            * Taking on a new task can be both challenging and rewarding. We naturally live in our comfort zones but tackling an unknown task can have it's rewards. Sometimes we may be surprised as to what we can learn to love.

There is pre-work that needs to be done before class. If you have any questions or need help, the instructor and T/A's are there to help.

* [__Github__](https://github.com/) is where you create web pages. (Update: Github pages are all created, edited and organized using VS Code)
* [__Slack__](https://slack.com/) is used for chat communication between you and your classmates.
* [__Remo__](https://remo.co/) is the virtual classroom where you can collaborate with your classmates and get help when needed.
* __Canvas__ is the class information. It has information such as the Syllabus, assignments and critical information about your work.  

The class is intended to get you set up and going. If you are worried about making a webpage - DONT! Github uses markdown language which really simplifies making a website. You can use HTML but the markdown is much simpler place to start. The class takes chronological steps to make it easier to understand.

HTML uses opening and closing brackets "<>" where markdown uses simple syntax. The markdown language can be as simple as using an "#" depending on what you need.
