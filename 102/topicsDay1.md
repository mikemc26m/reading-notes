# Day 1 Topics - Synopsis

On day 1 of Coding 102 you will:

* __Morning__:
Set up accounts with: Github, Slack, Remo and Canavas. By lunchtime you will have made your first webpage.
* __Afternoon__: Get your computer ready for Visual Studio. You will need VS for the coming days.

There is pre-work that needs to be done before class. If you have any questions or need help, the instructor and T/A's are there to help.

* __Github__ is where you create web pages.
* __Slack__ is used for chat communication between you and your classmates.
* __Remo__ is the virtual classroom where you can collaborate with your classmates and get help when needed.
* __Canvas__ is the class information. It has information such as the Syllabus, assignments and critical information about your work.  

The class is intended to get you set up and going. If you are worried about making a webpage - DONT! Github uses markdown language which really simplifies making a website. You can use HTML but the markdown is much simpler place to start. The class takes chronological steps to make it easier to understand.

HTML uses opening and closing brackets "<>" where markdown uses simple syntax. The markdown language can be as simple as using an "#" depending on what you need.
