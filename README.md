My reading notes journal for Code Fellows.

Growth Mindset - The attitude of contenuous learning. Three main ways to keep on the path to personal growth:
* Paying Attention
  * Growth sometimes comes from learning from others. This can be accomplished simply by paying aattention. You can gain valuable information by seeing what others have gone through. 
* Never Stop Learning
  * None of us know it all. Theere is a saying if you do the thing you love, then you will never work a day in your life. **DOING** things and assessing the results can give insightful information on what works and what doesn't. Practice, repetition and even failure hone ones abilities. 
* Challenges / Rewards
  * Taking on a new task can be both challenging and rewarding. We naturally live in our comfort zones but tackling an unknown task can have it's rewards. Sometimes we may be surprised as to what we can learn to love.
